# Anvil-Points-Classification-Project
This repository utilizes Anvil to create a website. Given a CSV file with points in the form of x and y coordinates, this website will help you classify the arm each point belongs to (arm 0 or 1). The CSV file "xy_locs" is a sample file that can be used to test out the website.

The link to the website (to login, can use username "example@gmail.com" and password "123"):
